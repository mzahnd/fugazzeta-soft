# Hi!

My name is Mart√≠n [^acute-accent]. I'm a 23 year old computer engineering 
student from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I started this website on mid-2021 mainly to learn about web development 
[^web-development] and practice a little bit my english writting. I'd also like
to keep record of my learning process in general by posting notes blog posts
about anything interesting I'm trying to comprehend.

You can check my [LinkedIn profile][lk-profile] and 
[GitHub account][gh-account] or, even better, [Contact Me][contact-link].

[^acute-accent]:
    *With* an [acute accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent), please.

[^web-development]:
    I'll publish a few posts and notes about how I built this site and my
    learning process for doing so.
