Even if you have already installed CUPS, restart the service to make sure that **it is** running.
```console
]# systemctl restart org.cups.cupsd.service
```

## Fixing missing .so files ^[If you can not locate the missing files, try running the steps to download and install the hp plugin first.]
Run hp-setup and log its stderr to a file. Be aware that after choosing the printer, the "missing pluggin" o any other screen might not be seen when doing this.
```console
]$ hp-setup -g &> ~/hp-setup.log
]$ cat ~/hp-setup.log
```

When openning the file, you'll se something like:
```text
hp-setup[19265]: debug: Either /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp2000S1.so file is not present or symbolic link is missing
```

You have to locate where is the .so file
```console
]$ locate libsane-hp2000S1
```

And create a link to it (if you're having trouble creating the link, make sure that the destination folder exists with `mkdir -p /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/sane/`, for example).
```console
]# ln -s /usr/lib/sane/libsane-hp2000S1.so /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp2000S1.so
```
After having done this with all the files and getting no more errors when opening hp-setup, continue to the next step.

## Downloading hp-plugin

Apparently, the MIT server has some trouble retrieving the key, so we will change the line 45 on `/usr/share/hplip/base/validation.py` from `pgp.mit.edu` to `keyserver.ubuntu.com`.

After that, run the plugin utility, download it and install it.
```console
]$ hp-plugin -i
```

## Checking that there are no missing dependencies.
Run
```console
]$ hp-doctor
```
And read its output to verify if any dependency marked as _REQUIRED_ is missed. If so, install it.

## Final step
Run
```console
]$ hp-setup
```
:)
